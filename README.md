```
*

## Usage

A quick example:

```python
from sketchpy import canvas

# Trace from an image
obj = canvas.trace_from_image(r"path_to_image.jpg")

# Draw the sketch
obj.draw()
```
##üîóüñáÔ∏èDrawing From SVG file
You can sketch image uinsg the class color_sketch_from_svg, which takes the inpu in svg formate and then sketches it. Example Code:
```bash
from sketchpy import canvas

if __name__ == "__main__":
    obj = canvas.color_sketch_from_svg("Image Path")
    obj.draw()


```

##üîóConverting Image to SVG formate
Sketchpy requires specific type of SVG file formate to work properly, hence this version includes a standalone svg converter function with it use the follow code to convert you images to svg files
```
bash
    from sketchpy import canvas
    canvas.get_svg(IMG_PATH)
```

It takes the image from the IMG_PATH and converts it into an svg file
But to access this SVG converter you have to complete a shorturl, don't worry you need to do this only once a day
Use brave browser to complete it with ih 20 sec.
---
##Sketching form .npy file
Insted of waiting for the svg file to load, you can saved .npy file and use that for future use, use the following code to draw your image from saved data file
```
bash

from sketchpy import canvas
obj = canvas.color_sketch_from_svg(None)
obj.draw(file = 'data.npy')
```
###Library Example
